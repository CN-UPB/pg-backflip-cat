It is also notable that traefik integrates easily with every major cluster technology such as Docker, Kubernetes etc. In this experiment, we concentrate on configuring traefik as a load balancer and it is installed as an Ubuntu-based docker image using the binary files coupled with a manual configuration file (traefik.toml) that directs traefik to balance the incoming load among web servers. This experiment is also extended for the first time to use multiple connection points in tng-bench at the output.

It uses a typical man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) to intercept HTTP and HTTPS connections between client and a web server. It works similar to Squid proxy by accepting connections from clients and forwarding them to the target server. Most of the other proxies are focused on speed optimization through caching and content filtering. The main goal of mitmproxy is to monitor, capture and modify the connections in realtime",
