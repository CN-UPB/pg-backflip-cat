It designed for maximum performance and stability in web server. NGINX can also function as a proxy server for Email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers. The motivation for NGINX was to create as fastest web server and maintaining that excellence. NGINX also is frequently placed between clients and a second web server, to serve as an SSL/TLS terminator or a web accelerator. Acting as an intermediary, NGINX efficiently handles tasks that might slow down your web server, such as negotiating SSL/TLS or compressing and caching content to improve performance. Dynamic sites, built using anything from Node.js to PHP, commonly deploy NGINX as a content cache and reverse proxy to reduce load on application servers and make the most effective use of the underlying hardware. NGINX is multifunctional tool as it uses same name tool for the load balancer, reverse proxy and web server. ",

Using RADIUS allows authentication and authorization for a network to be centralized, and minimizes the number of changes that have to be done when adding or deleting new users to a network.\n\nFreeRADIUS can authenticate users on systems such as 802.1x (WiFi), dialup, PPPoE, VPN's, VoIP, and many others. It supports back-end databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft Active Directory, Redis, OpenLDAP. It is used daily to authenticate the Internet access for hundreds of millions of people, in sites ranging from 10 to 10 million+ users.",
